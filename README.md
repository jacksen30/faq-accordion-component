# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

This is my personal solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects, they provide you with a jpg of what the design or component should look like at each viewport width and then you write the code to make the design a functional website.

## Project Overview and Reflections

Working on this project gave me a chance to delve into the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements, exploring their semantic use in creating accordion components. The hands-on experience of getting to experiment with these elements was really fun, and I foresee their applicability in numerous future web development builds that I will work on.

At a glance, the user interface may appear straightforward, yet the complexity lies in integrating multiple images for what may apear to the end user as a single illustration, to achieve this demanded meticulous positioning and layering, an excellent exercise in applying my CSS positioning skills in a practical scenario.

Completing this project was a great experience. It has equipped me with useful insights into accordion construction and the practical use of the `<details>` and `<summary>` tags, knowledge that I am eager to apply to current personal projects.
